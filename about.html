A floating network of interconnected, anchored massive organic growing modules dampens wave energy and reduces flooding, storm damage, and erosion on shore while improving nearshore water quality. These biomass modules are seeded with marsh grass at the surface, and are home to many seaweeds below the waterline, all of which add significant mass and frictional surface area and provide habitat for many types of creatures, human and non-human.</p></div></div></div><div class="container anchor mb-4" id="Origins"><h2 class="font-monument text-center">Origins</h2><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0">In 1878, the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted began the design of the 1,100-acre connected park system in Boston known as the Emerald Necklace. He envisioned it as a collective space where inhabitants of the crowded, chaotic city could find healthy activity and mental solace. A series of pleasant public spaces brought nature back to the city, where it could be enjoyed by all.

Civil infrastructure for climate resilience should be accessible to all people, encouraging everyday use and environmental benefits as well as protection during catastrophic storms.
