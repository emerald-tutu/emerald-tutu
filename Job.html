The Emerald Tutu is seeking to add a passionate, versatile worker to our team who is interested in engineering with plants and coastal infrastructure, and who is not afraid to get their hands dirty. The position will primarily involve building prototypes and material work, running experiments, analyzing results, and representing/demonstrating conclusions and project narratives. Additional responsibilities will vary widely, and we are seeking someone who is equally comfortable figuring things out with physical prototyping and coding for numerical modeling, for example—rising to the occasion to drive the project forward. Work is in person in Cambridge and East Boston.

### QUALIFICATIONS 
Applicants should have some experience in the Marine Sciences including, but not limited to, the following:

- Marine/wetland ecology
- Behavioral ecology
- Coastal engineering 
- Coastal resilience planning
- Oceanography
- Biogeochemistry

Other beneficial skills:

- Numerical/computational modeling experience
- Supply chain/production experience
- Hands-on fabrication experience
- Community organizing (english, español)
- Business development

These experience types and skills can be learned—they are secondary in importance to passion for ecological engineering and a hands-on DIY approach. QTBIPOC especially encouraged to apply.

### TERMS

- Duration: Seeking ~2 years 
- Start: Early 2023
- Salary: Commensurate with experience
