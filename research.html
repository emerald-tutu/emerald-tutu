This model was one of our earliest methods for physical simulation; subsequent physical prototyping and wave tank experiments have allowed us to compare the model behavior with a variety of laboratory-observed conditions and tune its accuracy. In other words, the physical dynamics shown here are true to the way an eight-row network of actual marine biomass units would affect regular waves of NXNXNX height and NXNNXNX wavelength—the wave formation would diffract as shown, and overall wave energy would be reduced by roughly NXNXNXN percent.

By adjusting the input parameters of the simulation, such as wavelength and network configuration, the model is able to calculate corresponding conditions of the resultant wave behavior as it reacts to the different configurations. This allows for the optimization of the size and configuration of an Emerald Tutu project based on the environmental conditions of a particular site
</p></div></div><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0">1. Viscosity:
In fluid dynamics, viscosity represents the internal friction a fluid experiences as it flows through a boundary. It is a property of the fluid and is often encapsulated by a single constant value. The higher the viscosity constant, the more resistant it is to flow.  

2. Drag:
While drag also represents friction experienced by a fluid, unlike viscosity, it is the external friction generated by the interaction of a fluid with a solid surface or fluid of differing density. Viscosity is a property of the fluid, while drag is a function of the fluid velocity (relative to the object or surface) and cross sectional area of interaction.

3. Navier-Stokes Shallow Water Equations: 
The Navier-Stokes equations are cornerstone equations in fluid dynamics which represent Newton’s Conservation of Momentum and Conservation of Mass laws for Newtonian fluids (fluids, like water and honey, that have constant viscosity at a constant temperature). Integrating these partial differential equations in a shallow-water context removes the vertical velocity (z-direction) term due to the assumption that the scale of the vertical velocity is small compared to the horizontal velocity scale. In this case, we use the non-conservative form to include representations of viscosity, drag and the Coriolis Effect. 

4. Boussinesq Approximations: 
The Boussinesq approximations assume that variations in fluid density are so small that they have no effect on the flow field except to provide buoyancy forces. This assumption allows for the elimination of the vertical variable from flow equations while still maintaining influences of the vertical structure. In doing so, the model is now able to incorporate dispersion effects which better represent wave propagation. 

5. No-Slip Lateral Boundary: 
This describes the boundary condition at which the fluid interacts with its surrounding layer. The no-slip condition assumes that the speed of the fluid layer in direct contact with the boundary layer is identical to the velocity of the boundary layer. The simulated box boundaries therefore do not have any edge or channeling effects.

6. Finite-Difference Scheme: 
This describes the method for how the solver computes the numerical equations. In this method, derivatives are written in terms of discrete quantities of dependent and independent variables. Compared to other methods of computation, such as spectral and pseudospectral, the finite difference method is more complex and less accurate; however, it is also more flexible and able to handle varying coefficients, differing boundary conditions and irregular geometries making it more suitable for the variability and irregularity of coastal shorelines.

Through validation from the Wave Tank Lab Tests, we confirmed that with enough rows, an Emerald Tutu network can progressively dampen any wave. We also found that the unit spacing affects damping properties, with tighter networks more effective at damping incoming waves. Diversifying the size of the mats also improved damping efficacy, but was not as impactful as the network spacing. Try the interactive Data Viewer GUI to see how these factors affect performance in varying wave conditions.</p></div></div><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0 blue-bg">WHAT WE LEARNED</p></div></div><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0">To create a mathematical representation of the floating unit network in this simulation environment, we first guessed at physical fluid properties (increased density, viscosity, and drag constants) that we thought would represent our vegetated mat network. Then, after our 44-unit prototype network was built in the wave lab in Summer 2021, we were able to reverse-engineer more accurate physical fluid properties from observed physical performance in the lab. To put our assumptions and numerical representation techniques to the test, we used our research from the wave tank experiments conducted at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Tank Research Facility to verify results through our many trials with different network configurations and wave types. Proving that our numerical model can accurately reproduce the observed network behavior in any wave condition is a critical step in confidently showing the efficacy of a given network in situ. </p></div></div><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0 blue-bg">NUMERICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL VERIFICATION</p></div></div><div class="container text w-auto"><div class="row justify-content-center"><p class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xl-8 mb-2 p-0">This model was developed using standard fluid surface-resolving mathematics (Navier-Stokes shallow water equations, Boussinesq approximations, a no-slip lateral boundary, and a finite-difference scheme) and was run on a supercomputer.

Initial results proved the effectiveness of our design by demonstrating that small, short waves can be reduced by up to 90% of their original height. 

The tests also confirmed our hypothesis that the wave attenuation capacity is a function of the network configuration and initial (incoming) wavelength. The collected data showed that when waves were smaller than the size of the mats, the network was highly effective at wave dampening. This effectiveness decreased with an increase in wavelength, but did not drop to zero until wavelengths were approximately 8 meters, or the aggregate size of all 4 rows. 
These results have been significant to our team and provided a crucial step in our continued research. Of course, we must remember this is a controlled laboratory experiment that comes with its own opportunities and constraints. While the wave generator allowed us to test very specific conditions, the boundaries of the wave tank created results that would not be experienced in an unconstrained coastal environment. Using our numerical model and control tests, we are working towards removing reflections in the data to remove these impacts and refine our model.

Wave Height: 
Wave height, also known as amplitude, is the height of the wave from the equilibrium position to the maximum distance traveled. The distance from the lowest point of a wave to the height is 2x the amplitude. Our experiments included a range of wave heights from 10 cm to 45 cm. 

2. Wave Period: 
Wave period is the time it takes for one full wave to pass a specific point. It is the inverse of wave frequency so a higher wave period means the waves have low frequency. Our experiments included a range of wave periods from 1 second to 6 seconds.

3. Network Configuration: 
Network configuration refers to the spacing and density of the mats relative to each other. Our experiments included a sparse configuration where the mats were spaced far apart and a dense configuration with less spacing between the mats. Additionally, we included tests of the dense configuration in which we simulated a higher concentration of submerged vegetation.

4. Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV): 
An ADV is an instrument used to measure water velocity in three dimensions of a water column. Using properties of sound waves, it measures the difference between emitted and received frequencies to calculate the relative velocity of the water.

5. Wave Gauge:  
Wave gauges use pressure sensors to measure and report water surface height as it changes with the height of a passing wave. Bottom-mounted gauges continuously monitor the pressure from the water above them, converting that value to a wave height profile. 

6. Infrared Camera: 
Infrared cameras installed on the instrumentation bridge beam out and receive light waves which are reflected by tracking devices mounted on each floating mat module. This allows for direct motion tracking of the mats in three-dimensions.

7. Force Sensors: 
Force sensors attached to the anchors measure and report the load imposed on the anchors by the tension of the floating mat modules. 

8. Wave Attenuation Capacity: 
Wave attenuation capacity refers to the ability of the network to reduce the height and energy of a wave.

9. Wavelength: 
Wavelength is the distance from the crest of one wave to the crest of the consecutive wave. It is determined by the velocity of the wave times the wave period. Our experiments included varied wavelengths from 1 meters to 10 meters.

In other words, the physical dynamics shown here are true to the way an eight-row network of actual marine biomass units would affect regular waves of NXNXNX height and NXNNXNX wavelength—the wave formation would diffract as shown, and overall wave energy would be reduced by roughly NXNXNXN percent.\n\nBy adjusting the input parameters of the simulation, such as wavelength and network configuration, the model is able to calculate corresponding conditions of the resultant wave behavior as it reacts to the different configurations. This allows for the optimization of the size and configuration of an Emerald Tutu project based on the environmental conditions of a particular site\n"],"isBlueBackground":null},{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["1. Viscosity:\nIn fluid dynamics, viscosity represents the internal friction a fluid experiences as it flows through a boundary. It is a property of the fluid and is often encapsulated by a single constant value. The higher the viscosity constant, the more resistant it is to flow.  \n\n2. Drag:\nWhile drag also represents friction experienced by a fluid, unlike viscosity, it is the external friction generated by the interaction of a fluid with a solid surface or fluid of differing density. Viscosity is a property of the fluid, while drag is a function of the fluid velocity (relative to the object or surface) and cross sectional area of interaction.\n\n3. Navier-Stokes Shallow Water Equations: \nThe Navier-Stokes equations are cornerstone equations in fluid dynamics which represent Newton’s Conservation of Momentum and Conservation of Mass laws for Newtonian fluids (fluids, like water and honey, that have constant viscosity at a constant temperature). Integrating these partial differential equations in a shallow-water context removes the vertical velocity (z-direction) term due to the assumption that the scale of the vertical velocity is small compared to the horizontal velocity scale. In this case, we use the non-conservative form to include representations of viscosity, drag and the Coriolis Effect. \n\n4. Boussinesq Approximations: \nThe Boussinesq approximations assume that variations in fluid density are so small that they have no effect on the flow field except to provide buoyancy forces. This assumption allows for the elimination of the vertical variable from flow equations while still maintaining influences of the vertical structure. In doing so, the model is now able to incorporate dispersion effects which better represent wave propagation. \n\n5. No-Slip Lateral Boundary: \nThis describes the boundary condition at which the fluid interacts with its surrounding layer. The no-slip condition assumes that the speed of the fluid layer in direct contact with the boundary layer is identical to the velocity of the boundary layer. The simulated box boundaries therefore do not have any edge or channeling effects.\n\n6. Finite-Difference Scheme: \nThis describes the method for how the solver computes the numerical equations. In this method, derivatives are written in terms of discrete quantities of dependent and independent variables. Compared to other methods of computation, such as spectral and pseudospectral, the finite difference method is more complex and less accurate; however, it is also more flexible and able to handle varying coefficients, differing boundary conditions and irregular geometries making it more suitable for the variability and irregularity of coastal shorelines.\n"],"isBlueBackground":false},{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["DEFINITIONS "],"isBlueBackground":true},{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["In creating this model and observing how the simulated waves interact with a simulated unit network, we were able to generalize the reactive properties of the marsh mat network that produce the wave dampening effect.
