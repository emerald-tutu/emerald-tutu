In other words, the physical dynamics shown here are true to the way an eight-row network of actual marine biomass units would affect regular waves of NXNXNX height and NXNNXNX wavelength—the wave formation would diffract as shown, and overall wave energy would be reduced by roughly NXNXNXN percent.\n\nBy adjusting the input parameters of the simulation, such as wavelength and network configuration, the model is able to calculate corresponding conditions of the resultant wave behavior as it reacts to the different configurations.

It is a property of the fluid and is often encapsulated by a single constant value. The higher the viscosity constant, the more resistant it is to flow.  \n\n","-  Drag:\n\nWhile drag also represents friction experienced by a fluid, unlike viscosity, it is the external friction generated by the interaction of a fluid with a solid surface or fluid of differing density. Viscosity is a property of the fluid, while drag is a function of the fluid velocity (relative to the object or surface) and cross sectional area of interaction.\n\n\n","- Navier-Stokes Shallow Water Equations: \nThe Navier-Stokes equations are cornerstone equations in fluid dynamics which represent Newton’s Conservation of Momentum and Conservation of Mass laws for Newtonian fluids (fluids, like water and honey, that have constant viscosity at a constant temperature). Integrating these partial differential equations in a shallow-water context removes the vertical velocity (z-direction) term due to the assumption that the scale of the vertical velocity is small compared to the horizontal velocity scale. In this case, we use the non-conservative form to include representations of viscosity, drag and the Coriolis Effect. \n\n","- Boussinesq Approximations: \nThe Boussinesq approximations assume that variations in fluid density are so small that they have no effect on the flow field except to provide buoyancy forces. This assumption allows for the elimination of the vertical variable from flow equations while still maintaining influences of the vertical structure. In doing so, the model is now able to incorporate dispersion effects which better represent wave propagation. \n","\n\n- No-Slip Lateral Boundary: \nThis describes the boundary condition at which the fluid interacts with its surrounding layer. The no-slip condition assumes that the speed of the fluid layer in direct contact with the boundary layer is identical to the velocity of the boundary layer. The simulated box boundaries therefore do not have any edge or channeling effects.\n\n","- Finite-Difference Scheme: \nThis describes the method for how the solver computes the numerical equations. In this method, derivatives are written in terms of discrete quantities of dependent and independent variables. Compared to other methods of computation, such as spectral and pseudospectral, the finite difference method is more complex and less accurate; however, it is also more flexible and able to handle varying coefficients, differing boundary conditions and irregular geometries making it more suitable for the variability and irregularity of coastal shorelines."],"isBlueBackground":true},{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["WHAT WE LEARNED"],"isBlueBackground":true},{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["In creating this model and observing how the simulated waves interact with a simulated unit network, we were able to generalize the reactive properties of the marsh mat network that produce the wave dampening effect.

Wave Period: \nWave period is the time it takes for one full wave to pass a specific point. It is the inverse of wave frequency so a higher wave period means the waves have low frequency. Our experiments included a range of wave periods from 1 second to 6 seconds.\n\n3. Network Configuration: \nNetwork configuration refers to the spacing and density of the mats relative to each other. Our experiments included a sparse configuration where the mats were spaced far apart and a dense configuration with less spacing between the mats. Additionally, we included tests of the dense configuration in which we simulated a higher concentration of submerged vegetation.\n\n4. Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV): \nAn ADV is an instrument used to measure water velocity in three dimensions of a water column. Using properties of sound waves, it measures the difference between emitted and received frequencies to calculate the relative velocity of the water.\n\n5. Wave Gauge:  \nWave gauges use pressure sensors to measure and report water surface height as it changes with the height of a passing wave. Bottom-mounted gauges continuously monitor the pressure from the water above them, converting that value to a wave height profile. \n\n6. Infrared Camera: \nInfrared cameras installed on the instrumentation bridge beam out and receive light waves which are reflected by tracking devices mounted on each floating mat module. This allows for direct motion tracking of the mats in three-dimensions.\n\n7. Force Sensors: \nForce sensors attached to the anchors measure and report the load imposed on the anchors by the tension of the floating mat modules. \n\n8. Wave Attenuation Capacity: \nWave attenuation capacity refers to the ability of the network to reduce the height and energy of a wave.\n\n9.
