The position will primarily involve building prototypes and material work, running experiments, analyzing results, and representing/demonstrating conclusions and project narratives. Additional responsibilities will vary widely, and we are seeking someone who is equally comfortable figuring things out with physical prototyping and coding for numerical modeling, for example—rising to the occasion to drive the project forward. Work is in person in Cambridge and East Boston.\n\n### QUALIFICATIONS \nApplicants should have some experience in the Marine Sciences including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- Marine/wetland ecology\n- Behavioral ecology\n- Coastal engineering \n- Coastal resilience planning\n- Oceanography\n- Biogeochemistry\n\nOther beneficial skills:\n\n- Numerical/computational modeling experience\n- Supply chain/production experience\n- Hands-on fabrication experience\n- Community organizing (english, español)\n- Business development\n\nThese experience types and skills can be learned—they are secondary in importance to passion for ecological engineering and a hands-on DIY approach.
