A floating network of interconnected, anchored massive organic growing modules absorbs wave energy and reduces flooding, storm damage, and erosion on shore while improving nearshore water quality. These biomass modules are seeded with marsh grass at the surface, and are home to many aquatic fauna and seaweeds below the waterline, all of which add significant mass and frictional surface area."],"isBlueBackground":null}]},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n24w0q7e6q0bk84uq7j4xn","name":"Origins","contents":[{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["In 1878, the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted began the design of the 1,100-acre connected park system in Boston known as the Emerald Necklace. He envisioned it as a collective space where inhabitants of the crowded, chaotic city could find healthy activity and mental solace. A series of pleasant public spaces brought nature back to the city, where it could be enjoyed by all. But, as a system, it also solved major drainage challenges of an industrializing city, and it integrated transit while balancing residential development. 140 years later, a group of friends from MIT took this same approach to solve a contemporary coastal urban problem with nature, collectivity, and resilience. As a part of an effort to radically redefine the way we as a society approach urban-scale problems and infrastructural solutions, they included a bit more seapunk and a lot more drag… "],"isBlueBackground":null},{"__typename":"VimeoEmbeddable","videoID":"266553400","iframeSrc":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/266553400?h=d46fc40e2d"}]},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n3siin7jgn0bk8nm8ad4n0","name":"Mission","contents":[{"__typename":"Text","paragraphs":["The goal of the Emerald Tutu is to provide a climate resilience infrastructure solution that is deployable, flexible, inexpensive, green, non-invasive, and a joy to experience. As is abundantly clear in our era, “gray infrastructure” coastal barriers and other traditional coastal engineering approaches are ineffective and even harmful, both ecologically and socially. Civil infrastructure for climate resilience should be accessible to all people, encouraging everyday use and environmental benefits as well as protection during catastrophic storms. Furthermore, it should economically empower local populations during its implementation and upkeep."],"isBlueBackground":null}]},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n3toqtfave0cimjzc29d9c","name":"Team","contents":[{"__typename":"PersonList","people":[{"name":"Gabriel Cira","title":"Project Lead","photo":{"height":584,"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/iGgC3BNHToCmMmgtV9XP","width":584},"bio":"Gabriel is a licensed architect based in Massachusetts.
