Hard materials reflect incoming energy, which may cause damage elsewhere, and they may break under extreme force—by contrast, soft materials are flexible and absorb energy. When a design requires a certain material property, we investigate where it occurs in nature and under what conditions, and attempt to incorporate the natural option whenever possible. This approach has led us to create a resilient hybrid ecosystem for our structures that is not a replica of any one natural living ecosystem.\n","highlight":true,"heading":"1.

This gives us the ability to expand over time as budgets allow, and to know that failure modes are not catastrophic. Our system can be spot fixed or have components swapped out easily.
