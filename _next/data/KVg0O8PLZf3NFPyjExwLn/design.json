Hard materials reflect incoming energy, which may cause damage elsewhere, and they may break under extreme force—by contrast, soft materials are flexible and absorb energy. When a design requires a certain material property, we investigate where it occurs in nature and under what conditions, and attempt to incorporate the natural option whenever possible. This approach has led us to create a resilient hybrid ecosystem for our structures that is not a replica of any one natural living ecosystem. "},{"id":"clgwqxrjuj3t20bitazciz6gz","itemTitle":"Elemental Engineering","itemDescription":"Our rigorous design method prioritizes elemental simplicity. We shy away from moving parts, embedded sensors, or “add on” solutions to design problems, instead focusing on the fundamental relationships between materials, organisms, and energy at a systems scale. "},{"id":"clgwqxrjuj3t30bitlahuc6e4","itemTitle":"Modularity, Scalability, Replaceability","itemDescription":"We design with regularity and redundancy. This gives us the ability to expand over time as budgets allow, and to know that failure modes are not catastrophic. Our system can be spot fixed or have components swapped out easily. There will always be situations more extreme than our design can handle, so we design with maintenance in mind rather than presuming to design for permanence."},{"id":"clgwqxrjuj3t40bitsbkgfp3b","itemTitle":"Ecosystems First","itemDescription":"We begin our design with intended beneficial effects on the local ecosystem, rather than solving an engineering problem and assessing its side-effects after the fact. Our approach prioritizes the creation of new habitats and the improvement of existing habitats, using ecosystems as a design guide every step of the way as we address the urban design challenges."}]}]},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl2jvy1eoa5yk0aiton70uujc","name":"Individual Module","contents":[{"__typename":"TooltipPicture","id":"cl2jvy1eoa5yl0aitmbwhznv5","annotatedPhoto":{"picture":{"photo":{"height":798,"width":800,"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/fYJXRZbLQAmnfjkKHzgn"}},"tooltip":[{"id":"cl2jvsuhta6sl0ck263wh3qq5","xPos":200,"yPos":50,"number":1,"text":"Salt marsh vegetation creates a dense tangled root network that binds substrate material together and provides a surface for microorganism growth as well as habitat for larger organisms.
