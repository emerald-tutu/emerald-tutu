Both natural, and human-induced changes are continually occurring and make uncertainty a large part of everyday life. Designing coastal infrastructure for 50 or 100 years in the future means this uncertainty is even greater. Scientists have used forms of predictive modeling for generations to reduce the uncertainty and provide estimates for the future. Our research relies on using sensible models accompanied by rigorous testing and a modular, flexible, and simple design to provide us with reasonable predictions and the ability to quickly respond to consequences of uncertainty."],"isBlueBackground":false},{"__typename":"Picture","id":"cl1n5qzzzfgk50ak7ea3b6980","photo":{"height":375,"width":500,"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/3GhJp2UUT0WLRP1sUW6j"},"altText":"Image","caption":null}]},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n5rxtd7p1l0bk8rnqm7zly","name":"Surface Wave Damping Simulations","contents":[{"__typename":"TooltipPicture","annotatedPhoto":{"picture":{"photo":{"height":368,"width":500,"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/eDJqQDLNRLKFTjzod5yw"}},"tooltip":[{"id":"cl1ojc9riwhct0bjxi71dxudb","xPos":30,"yPos":40,"number":1,"text":"Test tooltip"}]}}]}],"slug":"research","id":"cl0pmczva965a0dk6fyf4duqr","seo":null,"title":"Research","footer":{"pages":[{"id":"cl0pmbmyy7g3f0diu96hk7uz5","title":"Design","pageNumber":-2,"blocks":[{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n5e6g1fdfc0bjxat3303zu","name":"Design Principles"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl2jvy1eoa5yk0aiton70uujc","name":"Individual Module"}],"slug":"design"},{"id":"cl0pmdu1i969s0dk668yrz45a","title":"About","pageNumber":1,"blocks":[{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n23rnuf5dc0cimab2zhrhq","name":"Brief"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n24w0q7e6q0bk84uq7j4xn","name":"Origins"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n3siin7jgn0bk8nm8ad4n0","name":"Mission"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n3toqtfave0cimjzc29d9c","name":"Team"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n3uu3vfbc20ak7mka61n56","name":"Contact"}],"slug":"about"},{"id":"cl0pmczva965a0dk6fyf4duqr","title":"Research","pageNumber":3,"blocks":[{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n5km0ifg3s0cimgseno8fd","name":"Research Magnitudes And Methodologies"},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1n5rxtd7p1l0bk8rnqm7zly","name":"Surface Wave Damping Simulations"}],"slug":"research"},{"id":"cl0pmckir962x0dk6lzcgdzs3","title":"Timeline","pageNumber":4,"blocks":[{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl2juz4zfa1zh0ak0nt32kdb3","name":"The Emerald Tutu Begins..."},{"__typename":"Section","id":"cl1v7mkvriojz0cik0jm9b9f8","name":"In the News"}],"slug":"timeline"}],"address":"48 Quincy St,\nCambridge, Ma\n02138"},"header":true},"preview":true},"__N_SSG":true}
