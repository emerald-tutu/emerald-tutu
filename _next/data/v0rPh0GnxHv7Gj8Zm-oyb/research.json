This detail is not part of the actual Emerald Tutu network design, but highlights the difficulties of field work!\n","\n- The deformation of the mat meant that the available surface area above the waterline was significantly decreased, drowning some of the marsh grass vegetation\n","\n- Bird visitation was evidenced by shell fragments, droppings, and marsh grass grazing.
